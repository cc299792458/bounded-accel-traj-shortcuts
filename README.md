# Bounded-Accel-Traj-Shortcuts

This repository contains an implementation of a real-time trajectory smoothing algorithm based on the paper:  
**["Fast Smoothing of Manipulator Trajectories using Optimal Bounded-Acceleration Shortcuts"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5509683), ICRA 2010**.  

It efficiently generates shortcut trajectories that satisfy **position, velocity, and acceleration constraints**.
